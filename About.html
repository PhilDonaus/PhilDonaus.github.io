			    				<p>I solve <del>puzzles</del> problems. What I am good at is learning about a <del>puzzle</del> problem, getting into the weeds, and finding the <del>answer</del> solution to that <del>puzzle.</del> problem.</p>
			    				<p> I am someone who knows how to mobilize resources, develop a strategy, and fine tune an algorithm until a solution to your problem is found. I do this by striving to be the best Data Scientist, and the best people Influencer in the building.
			    				</p>
			    				<p> I fight for the right to be taught, to learn, and to grow in every role I step into. I adapt, inovate, improve, and improvise wherever I may be.</p>

	    					<h4>Science & Technology</h4>
	    					<p>I had the chance to intern at a wonderful company located on the old Bell Laboratory campus. Being there was important for me because the history of the place resonated with the company in the same way it did me. The future is imagined by dreamers, and created by doers. I got to be both at my internship, and I hope to carry that on in the next position I accept.</p>

	    					<h4>Art & Music</h4>
	    					<p>For me, my passion for music is central to getting to know me. In my spare time, I play 3 musical instruments, sing in a band I formed in college, and write my own covers of popular music.</p>
	    					<p>I take a lot of what I learned while playing music to my work and career. For me, it was the trial and error, patience, and determination to learn complicated peices by Chopin, or a Bach violin solo. It also meant when I performed in an orchestra or I led my orchestra as a conductor, teamwork is the key to success. It meant understanding everyone has an important role to play especially when performing Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin, and when I conducted new age, complicated peices in high school. Leading an orchestra has helped me learn how to work with those different personalities.</p>

	    					<h4>Engineering</h4>
	    					<p>I use a combination of computer programming, statistics, and algorithms to develop software that does the heavy lifting for analysts, sales agents, and executives. I solve problems by researching, simulating, and projecting the outcomes of an event, and using that information to impact strategy.</p>

	    					<h4>Business</h4>
	    					<p>I have focus, and determination.  My excitement for solving problems helps me fit perfectly in business facing teams, supporting other members, and being a point of outreach and communication to other businsses as well.</p>
